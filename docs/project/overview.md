# Project Overview

ARC Data Model is the workspace for the ARC process data model. It contains the markdown specification, derived schemas, example documents, reference material from upstream ARC/RO-Crate work, and F# implementation projects for ProcessCore and the SQL profile.

## Repository Shape

```text
ProcessCore/
├── docs/                 fsdocs documentation pages
│   └── spec/             normative model specification
├── schemas/              derived SQL and YAML schema representations
├── examples/             concrete YAML examples
├── references/           upstream and prior implementation reference material
├── src/                  F# libraries
├── tests/                Pyxpecto test project
└── build/                FAKE build targets
```

## Main Areas

- [Specification](specification.md) describes ProcessCore and the decoration model.
- [Examples and schemas](examples-and-schemas.md) explains the current schema drafts and example status.
- [Implementation](implementation.md) explains the F# projects, SQL profile, runtime adapters, and build commands.
- [Reference material](references.md) lists upstream profiles and preserved implementation notes.
- [Prior art notes](prior-art.md) summarizes the ARCtrl and query model background that shaped this repo.

## Documentation

Documentation is built with fsdocs from the `docs/` directory. Additional template content, including Mermaid support, lives in `docs/_head.html`.

Common commands:

```powershell
dotnet fsdocs watch
.\build.cmd BuildDocs
.\build.cmd WatchDocs
```

## Build And Test

The FAKE build project is invoked through the root wrapper scripts:

```powershell
.\build.cmd BuildSolution
.\build.cmd RunTests
.\build.cmd RunTestsAll
.\build.cmd TestJs
.\build.cmd TestPy
```

`RunTests` covers the .NET Pyxpecto suite. `RunTestsAll` additionally transpiles and runs JavaScript and Python test output.
